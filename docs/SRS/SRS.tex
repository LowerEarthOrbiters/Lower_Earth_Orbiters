\subsection{Societal Impact}
Our application is essential for society for several reasons. First, it directly supports the mission of the McMaster Interdisciplinary Satellite Team (MIST). This application can play a pivotal role for the success of MIST missions like NEUDOSE and PRESET by facilitating automatic scheduling and sending of commands to satellites as they orbit Earth. These missions are about understanding prolonged space radiation on human tissue and understanding the behaviour and impact it has on our atmosphere respectively. Our application can facilitate these missions thereby increasing the chance of these missions to being successful. The web-based interface makes the application accessible from various locations and devices, significantly improving accessibility and operational flexibility compared to traditional satellite control systems.

One significant advantage of this product over existing solutions is the user-friendly interface. It combines ease of use with the ability to schedule commands, predict satellite overpasses, and manage user authentication and authorization with modern protocols like OpenID Connect. This enhances operational efficiency and ensures secure, reliable satellite communication. Moreover, the application’s ability to log all commands and responses with different users is crucial for maintaining accurate records. 

It uses TLE data for accurate orbital predictions and incorporates UTF-8 character encoding for command exchanges, which enhances the system's robustness and fault tolerance. The web-based interface makes the application accessible from various locations and devices, significantly improving accessibility and flexibility compared to traditional satellite communication systems.


\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
Operators have access to many functions that they previously didn't, and can act on these functions with the click of a button. They can perform the same actions as they did before, but with more efficiency and ease. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Satellite Engineers
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Role: Engineers responsible for the operation of PRESET CubeSat, their next mission about understanding the behaviour of electrons and their impact on our atmosphere. 

        \item Interest: Satellite engineers may be involved in the testing and integration of the application with the satellite systems. This can help with understanding what aspects of the UI that maybe unclear or confusing.  

    \end{itemize}
    \item Command Operators
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Role: Users who utilize the application for mission control activities
        \item Interest: These are the end users of the Mission Control Terminal application. Their main focus is in the functionality, intuitiveness and responsiveness of the application.

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application Administrators: This is someone who has the authority, background knowledge and understanding about satellite communication, sending commands and executing schedules. They have the authority in the MIST team to change another operator's permission when necessary. A good example of this would be the Principle Investigators or the Team Leads for different missions.  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Responsible for user management where they can add, edit and define roles for operators
        \item Allowed to modify the permission list for each target and user.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Operators: This is a person who does not have the same authority as the team leads or the Principal Investigator but plays an active role in the execution of a mission. They are very involved in the day to day and understand the nuances and how to communicate with satellites. They have experience in communicating and executing schedules and commands. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users who are primarily scheduling commands to a target satellite. This includes creating, editing and deleting scheduled commands and sequences
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
Ordering of priorities based on the different user roles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application Administrators: highest priority as they manage user and target access control.
    \item Operators: second and base role that a user can have. A user with this role is allowed to access the application and schedule commands to a target satellite.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Participation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Operators: Operators are users who will be benefiting from this application and they will be actively interacting with the software application to schedule commands and gain data from the satellite. As a result, they will have a high involvement when ensuring the functionality of the application.
    \item Administrators: administrators will also have an active involvement in the usage of this software application. They will benefit by being able to easily manage user accounts in addition to scheduling commands to a target satellite. Therefore, the level of participation that application administrators have in this application is high.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Muhammad Danyal and Mission operations and control team
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Role: Software Specialist on Mission Operations and Control Team
        \item Interest: As a software specialist, Muhammad’s primary focus is in the functionality and usability of the Mission Control Terminal application.

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Formalized Math and the Application Flow }
  
\textbf{1. Commands Sent to the Satellite Must Be Encrypted}

\paragraph{Definitions:}
Let $C$ be the set of all commands that can be sent to satellites, $S$ be the set of all satellites, and $E$ be the set of all encrypted commands.\\

\textbf{Functions:}
\begin{itemize}

  \item Send: $g : E \times S \rightarrow \text{``Sent''}$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Users Sending Data to the Application}

\textbf{Relation:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Scheduling Relation: $H \subseteq S \times Sc$.
\end{itemize}



\section{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{FR-1\\}
    
    The MCT must run as a web application consisting of a graphical UI accessible through a web browser and TCP port to communicate commands. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} We believe a web application is the most appropriate way to achieve communication between users and the satellite. 
    
    \item{FR-2\\}
    
    The MCT must manage a list of users and its data, specifying the roles and all its associated actions. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is to ensure that the system has a list of users to verify who’s allowed to enter and who isn’t. 

    \item{FR-3\\}
    

    The MCT will present a graphical interface allowing users to enter, select, and execute satellite commands while receiving text output from each command. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is important because this is one of the most basic functions of our application, which includes three fundamental functions. The text output allows the user to understand the process as it’s happening so they are in the know. 

    \item{FR-4\\}
    
    The MCT will log all commands sent to and received from each target with timestamps. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is helpful when the system runs into errors, because it’s easy to trace and determine what command caused it. 

    \item{FR-5\\}
    
    The MCT must present a graphical user interface to create, edit, and delete automated command sequences. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} A graphical user interface enables intuitive interaction between the user and the system and improves the overall user experience. 

    \item{FR-6\\}
        
    The MCT must have an option to interrupt an executed command sequence during execution. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is to allow the user to undo if a command was sent as a mistake or incorrect on their part. This will save plenty of time for the user rather than having to wait till the original command has been processed. 

    \item{FR-7\\}
    
    The MCT must store a list of allowed commands and automated sequences for each target, specified using regular expressions. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This will ensure the system can verify a command when inputted by a user so that it matches to an allowed list. Otherwise, any command might influence a target which can cause damage.

    \item{FR-8\\}
        
    The MCT must store a list of allowed commands and automated sequences for each user, specified using regular expressions. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This will ensure the system can verify the user so that it matches to an allowed list of users. Otherwise, any command by any user can negatively influence the satellite. 

    \item{FR-9\\}
    
    The application administrator will be able to edit the permission list for each target and user. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} An admin user who is responsible enough has been given permission to edit the list of targets and users. Without this functionality, if a user or command is attempting to cause damage it cannot be reprimanded. The admin user can remove or delete them to avoid said damage. 

    \item{FR-10\\}
    
    The MCT will be able to reject a user from executing a command unless that command matches the permission list criteria for the originating user. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is vital because a command has to fit the permission list criteria in order for it to be allowed to run. Without this constraint, any command would be eligible to run which would be out of scope for this project. Specifically, it has to fit the criteria for that user group as different groups have different permissions for commands. 

    \item{FR-11\\}
    
    The MCT will be able to reject a user from executing a command unless that command matches the permission list criteria for the command target. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is important because a command has to fit the permission list criteria for it to run. Specifically, it has to fit the criteria of commands for that command target, because each target has commands specifically associated to it. 

    \item{FR-12\\}
    
    The MCT must be able to schedule commands and automated command sequences for future execution. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is important because a user may not have the time to wait or schedule a command for later. Through this, a user can save time to run commands without having to wait. 

    \item{FR-13\\}
        
    The MCT will present a graphical user interface to create, edit, and delete scheduled commands and sequences. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} A graphical user interface presents an intuitive interface for the user to interact with the satellite through create, edit and delete functions. A visual UI is most intuitive for every human to interpret and work with. 

    \item{FR-14\\}

    The MCT will present a graphical user interface to select and edit the satellites of interest. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} A graphical user interface presents an intuitive interface for the user to interact with the select and edit the satellites of interest. A graphical UI is most appropriate solution for this function.

    \item{FR-15\\}    

    The MCT will display the current orbital state for satellites of interest, elevation, and solar illumination. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is very important because it displays what the user is working with. For each satellite of interest, its elevation, orbital state and its illumination are vital pieces of information for the user to know. Presenting these on the screen is appropriate. 
    
    \item{FR-16\\}

    The MCT must be able to schedule commands when a satellite enters a user-specified elevation threshold over the ground station coordinates. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This allows the user to manipulate any satellite within the threshold. This enables the user to play around with more satellites as their threshold is subject to preference. 

    \item{FR-17\\}
    
    The MCT must be able to schedule commands when a satellite enters or exits in the covered area. \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} This is a core function of the application. The application can only manipulate and schedule commands for satellites within this area. Beyond this area would be too difficult for the application to manage. 

\end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Adaptability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item N/A
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Requirements}
\subsection{Access Requirements}

\subsubsection*{AR-1:}
The application shall support multi-factor authentication such that a user must verify their identity through their registered email account. \\
\textbf{Rationale} Having multi-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security to the application, ensuring that unauthorized users are prohibited from accessing sensitive user and system data.
 \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{Phase in Plan}: This requirement will start phasing in after the system has completed every other core functionality, which will be a few days before February 5th, 2024.
         \item\textbf{This Access Requirement will no longer be implemented.}

    \end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{AR-2:}
The application shall not authenticate a user who has attempted to login with the same credentials ten times, consecutively. The application shall have a timeout period of five minutes before the user can authenticate themselves. \\
\textbf{Rationale} By having a timeout period for a set number of unsuccessful authentication attempts, it protects user accounts from unauthorized access and improves security.


\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\subsubsection*{IR-1:}
The application shall periodically fetch TLE and calculate satellite overpasses to ensure the most recent data is being used to predict satellite overpasses. \\ 
\textbf{Rationale:} An issue with calculating satellite overpasses is the variation in TLE and other conditions. Periodically retrieving and recalculating this piece of information will ensure a more accurate prediction of overpasses.

\subsubsection*{IR-2:}
The application shall use a minimum elevation as a point of reference to evaluate whether a connection to the satellite can be made. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} In the case that a satellite is below the minimum elevation required to make a connection, the scheduled commands may not work and as a result, produce incomplete data. By having a minimum point of reference, the system can assess if a satellite is out of range.

\subsubsection*{IR-3:}
Operators shall be informed of errors that occur during the scheduling of commands, however, it is the operator’s responsibility to ensure the validity of the commands. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} Since the application allows operators to send and schedule commands to the satellite, it is possible that an incorrect command is sent.  In this case, it would be helpful to highlight the errors found in the operator’s input data.

\subsubsection*{IR-4:}
The system shall have a backup and recovery mechanism which is capable of restoring the database to its most recent correct state in the event of unexpected data failures. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} A situation may occur where the database enters into an unknown or corrupt state. The presence of a backup and recovery mechanism ensures that the information in the database is still accessible by rolling back to the most recent correct state.

\subsubsection*{IR-5}
In the event of a system, network, or satellite failure, all missing data fields shall be labelled with an appropriate error message as part of the data validation process. These error messages shall adhere to a standardized format. \\
\textbf{Rationale} There may be cases where a scheduled command produces responses with missing data attributes. By identifying the incomplete data using standardized error messages, it provides a consistent data state across all validation processes.

\subsubsection*{IR-6}
Cross-browser testing across a range of browsers shall be performed to ensure the application functions consistently. \\
\textbf{Rationale} Due to slight variations in browsers such as Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, it is important to assess the performance of the application across all user-intended environments.

\subsubsection*{IR-7}
The code base shall have HTML and CSS checks to ensure compatibility across different devices and browsers. \\
\textbf{Rationale} Incorporating the above checks can identify errors in the code base as well as possibly improve the application’s user interface.

\subsubsection*{IR-8}
All components which are required for scheduling operations shall be evaluated on their efficiency, where each component must complete within a minimum time frame. \\
\textbf{Rationale} By having a pipeline to test parts of the duration of a code, it can prevent situations where there may exist an inefficiency in scheduling operations.


\subsection{Privacy Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Service security} Network ports exposed by the MCT should be secured using a reputed cryptographic protocol.
    \begin{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}

Quinn's Reflection
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Throughout this capstone project, will have to collectively learn various skills around project management, front-end/back-end development, devops, and more. Even with the collective years of experience of the team, building an entire system from scratch will prove to be a challenge. For me, I anticipate acquiring finer front-end development, UX and project management skills, due to my current interests in development, team management, and as they are skills needed for this project.

    \item Two approaches of learning front-end development and UX skills are online courses, and lots of development inside and outside the capstone project. These approaches are suitable for learning hard skills, and fill in the gap of knowledge that may exist. In addition, learning project management skills will be done through online courses, and speaking to professional project managers, to learn from. Project management as a skill is very personal to the individual, and being able to pick up tips and tricks from various professionals in the industry will ensure growth and eventually mastery of the skill.
\end{enumerate}

Diamond's Reflection
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To ensure the success of this project, the team will have to follow all of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles. This includes processes from gathering requirements, designing, coding and implementation to deploying and maintenance. These process require skills like documentation, front-end / back-end development, CI/CD and good teamwork. My current interest is in the back-end development of our project and acquiring more skills relating to it such as Node.js and database integration. 

    \item I am currently taking a web-development course in which there are tutorials on developing a strong back-end for your web applications. It also shows integration with the database, which in our project is MongoDB. Another way is to make small personal projects to apply and refine the skills I currently have. I will pursue the first approach since back-end technology is very vast and our project is also time constrained which means creating small projects could result not being able to contribute to my full capacity to our capstone project.
\end{enumerate}


Dhruv's Reflection
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To complete this capstone project, our team will have to be well acquainted with various technologies, software languages and other skills such as testing and deployment. Although I have some experience working with front and back end applications, creating a project with this level of depth and requirements is new to me. I would like to work on my front end skills through online resources such as courses or checking out other's projects on GitHub. With this exposure, it would allow me to expand on my own creativity but also learn some tips and tricks. My interest would be more front end related because I find the creativity and aesthetic part of creating a great user interface very fun and challenging.  
    \item I would like to learn more about front end and back end through Youtube, online courses and by trying mini projects throughout the term. I believe that by practicing and actually building is the most effective way to learn. Although there are time constraints, enough mini courses and tutorials online can provide enough knowledge for me to build this capstone project well. 

\end{enumerate}


Rishi's Reflection
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The capstone project will require deep understanding of multiples technological and project management concepts. These concepts will be related to backend, frontend, databases and authentication on the software side, and Development cycles, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) and documentation on the project management front. I would like to focus my development on the backend, databases and CI/CD. Although I have used these concepts during my internships and projects, I will need to acquire them in more detail for the successful completion of the capstone project.

    \item There are a lot of resources available to gain a better understanding of the technologies mentioned. These include online courses, youtube videos, numereous articles and help guides. By learning these concepts through the resources and continuously applying them in projects, I will be able to develop these skills in a capacity that will enable me to fullfill the project's requirements.
\end{enumerate}

Umang's Reflection
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
        In order to make sure this project achieves all of its targeted goals, the team will have to become familiar when applying the software development principles, in conjunction with the technological and project management skills. The scope of this project involves real-life stakeholders which requires a level of organization and good communication to ensure certain goals are met. In addition, since this is also a software development process, developing a strong understanding of the technology stack will also help streamline the development process. As a group, we have to sharpen our concepts on the applications of the software development life cycle, as well as frontend, backend, and CI/CD technologies. I am aiming to build on my backend development skills, particularly Node.js and MongoDB's database service. While I do have some knowledge on these systems, I will have to be more fluent in these technologies in order to develop a successful product.

    \item There are several resources, whether it is in the form of books or videos, to learn more about the technologies and processes mentioned above. I will learn by reading through the documentation of the technologies, as well as online articles and possibly courses.
\end{enumerate}

Next steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Backend development courses and documentation: Rishi, Diamond and Umang will take the initiative to gain a deeper understanding of the backend development technologies by looking through available courses and documentation provided by Node.js and MongoDB.
    \item Frontend development courses and documentation: Quinn and Dhruv will take the initiative to gain a deeper understanding of the frontend development technologies by looking through available courses and documentation provided by TypeScript and Next.js.
    \item CI/CD courses: Dhruv and Diamond will take the initiative to gain a deeper understanding of the CI/CD through available courses and guides.
\end{itemize}
